### Introduction
This project contains the common used network data for network reconstruction problem.
The data are generated based on the network structure and the network dynamic.
To obtain the data in time-series, it is essential to run the script in the folders.

Some baseline algorithms are also available. Easy to check and compare your algorithm on the benchmark problem.
